### Hi, I'm YK! ðŸ‘‹

I work as an Artificial Intelligence Engineer. I'm based in Seoul, South Korea.

Since 2021 I've been living and breathing AI machine learning systems and creating better algorithms for deeplearning. I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to make this world a little better through AI technology.

I'm always trying to grow and learn something new. I love to spend my spare time solving puzzles, playing guitar, studying languages, and falling into the thoughts of nice authors.

### What I'm focusing on:

Currently improving my AI deeplearning skills: TensorFlow, Keras, Python
